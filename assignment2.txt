DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN "EM"AND "REM"

1.Ems" (em): The “em” is a scalable unit that is used in web document media.
An em is equal to the current font-size, for instance, if the font-size of the document is 12pt, 1em is equal to 12pt.
Ems are scalable in nature, so 2em would equal 24pt, .5em would equal 6pt, etc. 
Ems are becoming increasingly popular in web documents due to scalability and their mobile-device-friendly nature.
Em is equal to the computed font-size of that element’s parent. For example, If there is a div element defined with font-size: 16px then for that div and for its children 1em = 16px.

2.Rem" (rem): Root ems, are always relative to the font-size of the <html> element of the html code. It doesn’t matter how deeply nested an element is, its rem lengths will always be a proportion of the font-size of <html>.
rem values are relative to the root html element, not to the parent element. That is, If font-size of the root element is 16px then 1 rem = 16px for all elements.

**"em” and “rem” are both relative units and scales accordingly with another element.
**“em” is relative to the font-size of the nearest or parent element while “rem” is relative to the html (root) font-size (the entire page).
